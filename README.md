# Fact1 - F1 App

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/31493c86-691a-4511-9260-63e6dfa3b3a4/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/fact1/deploys)

In order to follow the current Formula 1 season I wrote this simple, fast and most importantly mobile friendly app.

**[Live Demo](https://fact1.netlify.app/)**

### App mechanics

- Fetches data from **[Ergast Developer API](https://ergast.com/mrd/)**
- View event data & schedule (past, current & upcoming events)
- View driver standings and compare two drivers by clicking their card
- View constructor standings
- Settings menu for language, units and theme
- Controllable with keyboard

### Controls
